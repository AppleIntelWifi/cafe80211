PREAMBLE
--------
Q: Why is this license so strict against tonymacx86? Aren't they the good guys within the Hackintosh community?

A: No. See: https://github.com/khronokernel/Tonymcx86-stance

Q: Doesn't this license prevent any development to occur from that side of the community?

A: Historically, the majority of developments ORIGINATING from tonymacx86 are stolen, and
do not give any credit to the actual developers and authors (see: MultiBeast, UniBeast, etc..)
The short answer is, yes, but there are quite good reasons on why none of the prolific Hackintosh
developers are major contributors within the tonymacx86 community.
